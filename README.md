## Where's Walter

**Overview**
</br>Where's Walter is a web-based application written in React.js and TypeScript, and using React-Router-Dom. It is a personal passion project,
inspired by the need for a central platform where pet-owners can post lost and found notices, allowing for more effective communication and resulting in more
lost pets being reunited with their families.

**Goals**
- Further my understanding of TypeScript
- Utilize React.js v18.2.0 and React-Router-Dom v6.21.3
- Build a robust testing suite
- Build and deploy a backend via Google Cloud

**MVP**
- As a user, I should be able to see a card for each Lost and Found notice from my homescreen
- When I click on a card from my homescreen, I should see a more detailed version of that corresponding notice
- I should be able to toggle through multiple images on the detailed-notice view, if they exist
- I should be able to create and submit a notice, which should immediately be displayed on the home screen

**Future Iterations**
- As a user, I should be able to create an account and customize my profile
- I should be able to message with fellow users
- I should be able to comment on notices
