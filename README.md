[Wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKVNrSiE=/?share_link_id=667821852486) | [Deployed Site](https://wheres-walter-sepia.vercel.app/)

**Overview**
</br>Where's Walter is a web-based application written in React.js and TypeScript, and using React-Router-Dom. It is a personal passion project,
inspired by the need for a central platform where pet-owners can post lost and found notices, allowing for more effective communication and resulting in more
lost pets being reunited with their families.

The application is an ongoing project, with my current progress detailed below.

**Goals**
- Further my understanding of TypeScript
- Utilize React.js v18.2.0 and React-Router-Dom v6.21.3
- Build a robust testing suite
- Build and deploy a backend via Google Cloud

**MVP**
- ✅ As a user, I should be able to see a card for each Lost and Found notice from my homescreen
- ✅ When I click on a card from my homescreen, I should see a more detailed version of that corresponding notice
- ✅ I should be able to toggle through multiple images on the detailed-notice view, if they exist
- ✅ I should be able to create and submit a notice, which should immediately be displayed on the home screen

**Iteration 1.2**
- ✅ As a user, I should be able to leave comments on a notice
- As a user, I should be able to visit an About page as well as a page listing the information for local shelters
- As a user, I should be able to tab through the entire application, or use a screen reader without issue
- Incorperate testing suite, including unit and intergration
  
**Iteration 1.3**
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to subnit the New Notice form until all fields filled in
- As a user, I should see my submitted Notices as part of the data set after page refresh
 </br> *Integrate use of local storage, until backend is built out*

**Iteration 2.0**
- As a user, I should be able to create an account, with customizable personal information
- As a user, I should see be able to visit my account dashboard that details followed notices, my own notices, and relevant / new / updated notices in my area
- As a user, I should be able to follow other user's notices, and update or delete my own notices
- As a user, the local shelters I see on the Shelter's page should be populated based on my location
- As a user, I should be able to visit another user's profile by clicking on their username in a comment

**Future Iterations**
- As a user, I should be able to message with other users
- As a user, I should be able to share notices via text, social media, or email
