[Wireframe](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKVNrSiE=/?share_link_id=667821852486)

**Overview**
</br>Where's Walter is a web-based application written in React.js and TypeScript, and using React-Router-Dom. It is a personal passion project,
inspired by the need for a central platform where pet-owners can post lost and found notices, allowing for more effective communication and resulting in more
lost pets being reunited with their families.

**Goals**
- Further my understanding of TypeScript
- Utilize React.js v18.2.0 and React-Router-Dom v6.21.3
- Build a robust testing suite
- Build and deploy a backend via Google Cloud

**MVP**
- As a user, I should be able to see a card for each Lost and Found notice from my homescreen
- When I click on a card from my homescreen, I should see a more detailed version of that corresponding notice
- I should be able to toggle through multiple images on the detailed-notice view, if they exist
- I should be able to create and submit a notice, which should immediately be displayed on the home screen

**Iteration 1.2**
- Incorperate testing suite, including unit and intergration
- As a user, I should be able to tab through the entire application, or use a screen reader without issue

**Iteration 1.3**
- As a user, I shouldn't be able to subnit the New Notice form until all fields filled in
- As a user, I should see my submitted Notices as part of the data set after page refresh
 </br> *Integrate use of local storage, until backend is built out*

**Iteration 2.0**
- As a user, I should be able to create an account, with customizable personal information
- As a user, I should see be able to visit my account dashboard that details followed notices, my own notices, and relevant / new / updated notices in my area
- As a user, I should be able to follow other user's notices, and update or delete my own notices
- As a user, I should be able to view shelter information based on my user profile / current location
- As a user, I should be able to leave comments that link to my profile on other notices

**Future Iterations**
- As a user, I should be able to message with other users
- As a user, I should be able to share notices via text, social media, or email
